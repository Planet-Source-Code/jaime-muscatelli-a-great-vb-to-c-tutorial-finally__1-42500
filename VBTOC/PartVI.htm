<p>VB to C++ Part VI:</p>
<p>AHHH, ok, you should be familiar with the C++ IDE by now, and if you're not, 
  that is perfectly ok. Just go back through and look at the pictures and whatnot. 
  I am no longer going to include pictures of the resource window or anything 
  like that. But anything new I will screenshot for you :-). OK. Now we must move 
  on to dynamically creating windows and controls. But, if you want to stay in 
  the DialogBox part for now, check out the &quot;System Menu&quot; code I Included, 
  and you know what, I will look at the password code with you before we move 
  on, so open the code I included with this tutorial (password code). MAKE SURE 
  YOU OPEN THE .dsw. OK, now you should see nothing new in the code except for 
  some small things:</p>

<p>In the decs, we see this. We already know what the 2 includes are. What I did 
  here (and all of my apps) is declare a constanst sCAPTION, so if I ever rename 
  my program, I don't have to change every single entry for the caption (IE Message 
  Boxes or SetWindowText() calls.) I will just substitute sCAPTION and then just 
  change that one variable. Hows that HUH? The sPASS is needed for this specific 
  program only. It is the password that our program checks. Now this progra (if 
  you haven't ran it) opens a DialogBox with a textbox and you must enter &quot;Jaime&quot; 
  for you to &quot;enter&quot;. Nice example of chars and char comparison.</p>

<p>Now this code is interesting. We already know that it is calling the IDC_CONFIRM 
  (Confirm Button) code. I &quot;dimmed&quot; a char with 50 characters. See in 
  vb, a string would just be a string. In C, it is actually an array of characters. 
  That number can be any amount. I used 50 because It was cool. Then I dimmed 
  an integer lpass. The &quot;GetDlgItemText()&quot; is a pure C function that 
  gets the text of the item I specify, or in this case IDC_txtpass (textBox). 
  It is stored in sPassword, and the max length is 50. Now this is interesting, 
  why didn't we use if (sPassword = = sPASS)? Well, = = refers only to integers. 
  So I used a strcmp (String Compare) function, that returns 0 if it is true, 
  and 1 if false. So simply if lPass = the comparison, and the comparison is = 
  true, than it is = to 0, and then we can call that code !!!! Isn't this fun 
  yet? That is basically it, the rest of the code is just the main stuff all apps 
  have in it. Cool.</p>
<p>OK, we can now start CreateWindow and RegisterClass. Now, I could show you 
  the code in jpegs and stuff and go over every line, but that is useless. I am 
  going to go over the stuff that you would need to change or alter, and the rest 
  is plain stuff that you HAVE to include and have, so why reinvent the wheel? 
  Just use a template project etc...</p>
<p>Open the &quot;Win32&quot; source .dsw and compile and run it. Cool Huh? Now, 
  if you have an API Spy, get the class name of that and you will see that is 
  a custom one! Hey, that is how they do it. All I did was use some simple API 
  and another callback function. See the RegisterClass code? where it says ClassName 
  you can edit it, and change the sAppName constant in the dec part of the code 
  (up top). And edit some few things, and you get the drift. There really isn't 
  much to explain. Now, I did something special. I use Windows Media Player, But 
  I hate it that it is in the taskbar for hours, so I wrote a simple app in vb 
  a way long time ago that either hides or shows it. Well, once I started learning 
  c++, and Duplicated this project using pure C++ (The CreateWindow and RegisterClass 
  way, not even the DialogBox way! I am insane!!!!). Well, even though it was 
  a lot easier and faster to do it in vb (Hence vb is a r.a.d. RAPID APP DEVELOPMENT) 
  . Go to the WMP Code folder and compare side by side VB and C++ code doing the 
  exact same thing.</p>
<p>So I pretty much taught you the skeleton background of C++. Now go buy Morrison's 
  &quot;C++ for VB Programmers&quot; that teaches you not to relearn everyting 
  in c, but just how to create powerful dlls and activexs so you can use them 
  dynamically for your vb apps. It is such a great book. I owe a lot to him. Anyway, 
  have fun, and if you have ANY problems or questions contact me. My contact info 
  is in the readme file. I hope this helped you out a bit, and now you are not 
  as timid at C++, or use it just to create Icons like I used to back in the day 
  lol. </p>

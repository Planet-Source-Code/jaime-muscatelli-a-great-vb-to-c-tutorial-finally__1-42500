<p>VB TO C++ PART II:</p>
<p>(MAKE SURE you have read both the intro.txt and PartI.txt before proceeding)</p>
<p>Ok, we are now ready to go through a crash course in the C++ IDE. I am using 
  Microsoft Visual C++ 6 IDE, so I hope you are as well. If you don't have it, 
  go to Microsoft.com and download the introductory version of it. First off, 
  open up C++, then click on File&gt;New. This window will appear.</p>
<p><img src="pics/PROJECTMAN.JPG" width="559" height="399"></p>
<p>Ok, there are a lot of Project types. And if you notice, there are also tabs 
  at the top of this dialog. If you go to files, it will list certain files that 
  you could insert into your app. But don't worry about that now; all you need 
  to worry about now is the 'Win32 Application' Project type. As I have said in 
  PART I, MFC projects and Console apps are available, but I am not going to teach 
  those in this tutorial. So go ahead and click on the Win32 Application List 
  Item, and go to the textbox where it says Project Name, and type the name of 
  the project&gt;&gt;&gt; See, in C++, it will create most of the files with the 
  name you enter there, and also it will automatically create a folder (also with 
  the same name) in the directory specified (Location textbox). Ok, lets name 
  our project FirstApp, and hit ok. Now this window will appear. </p>
<p><img src="pics/STEP1Of1.JPG" width="476" height="384"></p>
<p>This is simply a window that asks you if you want C to create some standard 
  files for you, or create a totally empty project. (The Hello World thing is 
  garbage, don't worry about it, it is for newbies :-) .) Go ahead and click on 
  the &quot;A Simple Win32 Application&quot; radio button and then hit finish! 
  Now this window will appear.</p>
<p><img src="pics/NEWPROJINFO.JPG" width="412" height="424"></p>
<p>This just a confirmation of the files and project types that will be created 
  and opened for you. Go ahead and click ok. Now, once you hit ok, you will see 
  a progress bar in the bottom left corner, and then nothing (which is pretty 
  scary compared to VB opening things for you!). Now is the time for me to go 
  over the 'Workspace' window (the window in the next picture).</p>
<p><img src="pics/WORKSPACE.JPG" width="282" height="531"></p>
<p>Now, this is parallel to the VB project view workspace in vb. This just lets 
  you open and close files on the fly. (If your Item didn't automatically expand 
  (The project name &quot;FirstApp Classes&quot;, then go ahead and click on it.) 
  It will load, and then it will show you a globals Folder, which is just basically 
  an enumeration of your functions, subs, and global variables (Useful huh?!?). 
  The only thing that will be in it is this &quot;WinMain&quot; Function, but 
  I will get into that in the next part. Just as a reminder, this is in the 'ClassView' 
  tab, and we will next go over the 'FileView tab' of this workspace. The tabs 
  are on the bottom. Click on 'FileView', and this window will appear.</p>
<p><img src="pics/FILEVIEWWORK.JPG" width="259" height="466"></p>
<p>Go ahead and expand all of the expandable items, and it should look like this! 
  Now, to explain this is difficult, so bear with me (C++'s file system is a lot 
  more complicated than Vb's). Ok, the files part is self-explainitory, then the 
  'Source' Folder. This contains the .ccp files, or the C++ Source files. These 
  aren't really parallel to anything in vb, because they ARE NOT forms, yet they 
  could contain the code to initialize forms. As you use C++ more and more, you 
  will get used to this concept. The 'FirstApp.cpp' is the main cpp for this project, 
  yet there is no definite &quot;Main&quot; for Win32 in c++. I TOLD YOU THIS 
  WASN'T EASY! Now, the StdAfx.cpp is really not needed, yet it was one of the 
  files that C generated for us, so MAKE SURE you leave it in the project. </p>
<p>Next, the &quot;Header&quot; folder, which is parallel to a Module (.BAS) file 
  in vb, contains the C++ versions of the BAS module for C. This keeps eveything 
  nice and neat and simple. The resource folder is empty, for now, but will be 
  used later on to hold our Resources. &lt;&lt;&lt; What Are Resources? &gt;&gt;&gt; 
  Resources are simply any non-code object that is dynamicly or statically linked 
  to our program. IF that confused you , we can cheat and go to the Resource window. 
  Go to the Insert menu, and then click on resources. DON&quot;T CLICK ON ANYTHING!!!!!!!!!!! 
  Just look for now, but as you can see, it is a lot more complicated than vb. 
  Look here:</p>
<p><img src="pics/RESOURCE.JPG" width="351" height="271"></p>
<p>These are just simply some of the things that are linked to our program using 
  code. Yes, even Icons are placed in our project through code! EVERYTHING lol. 
  I know it makes you miss the glorious vb Properties window, but this will make 
  you a man ! Just close this window, but this was just to whet your appetite 
  for c++ lol. </p>
<p>Now, that is basically it! I will include more pictures as we discover new 
  features, but now we are off to the c++ syntax!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p>

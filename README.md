### Description

Ok, yes we all love vb. But didn't / don't you want to learn and harness the power of c++? THIS TUTORIAL INCLUES EVERYTHING for starting out from vb to c++. This is a great, authoritive, comprehensive tutorial that shows you C++ side by side using vb code. Six part tutorial that covers everything from syntax to the IDE to 2 types of Win32 window creation. Callback functions, and

over 25 screenshots with the side by side code and tutorials. You should have a pretty good handle on vb, yet it is EXTREMELY EASY to FOLLOW! Comes with source and example code, duplicate programs written in vb and then in c++, shows how to use c++ (WITHOUT CHEEZY MFC) and the REAL Win32 way. Make your own windows with your own classnames, use DialogBox(); Declaring Variables, CALLBACK functions, Fully commented. You may say that you don't need c++, but how do you think the API Dlls are made? Not with VB's ActiveX Dll. You can integrate c++ with VB by writing complex dlls and simply calling them in VB! I Promise you success! ohhh it is so sweet.This will teach you a lot. PLEASE download and vote! Check it out!
